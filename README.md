# Infinite Variance

Welcome to the **Infinite Variance** project repository!

This repository serves as the companion codebase for the [Infinite Variance](https://www.infinite-variance.com/) website, where we delve into the intersection of mathematical concepts, storytelling, and narrative structures. Each folder within this repository corresponds to an article published on the website, containing the associated Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) with the code used to explore and visualize the ideas discussed in the article.

## Project Overview

**Infinite Variance** is a platform dedicated to exploring the dynamics of storytelling through the lens of mathematics, data analysis, and probability theory. Our articles aim to provide a unique perspective on how mathematical models can be applied to understand and analyze narrative structures, character development, and the evolution of story arcs.

### What's Inside

In this repository, you'll find:

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Each notebook is linked to a specific article and contains the code necessary to reproduce the visualizations and analyses presented in the article.
- **Readme Files:** Accompanying each notebook is a readme file that explains the code's purpose, the concepts being modeled, and how it relates to the article.

### How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse the Folders:** Each folder in this repository represents an individual article. The folder contains:
   - A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) with the code.
   - A README file providing an overview of the code and its connection to the article.

2. **Run the Code:** You can download or clone the repository, navigate to the desired folder, and run the notebooks in your local environment to recreate the analyses and visualizations.

3. **Learn and Explore:** Use the code and visualizations as a starting point for your own exploration of the mathematical models applied to narratives.

### Expanding the Repository

As new articles are published on [Infinite Variance](https://www.infinite-variance.com/), additional folders will be added to this repository. Each new folder will contain the code and readme file corresponding to the latest article, allowing you to stay up-to-date with the ongoing exploration of narrative structures.

# Continuity, Jumps, and Measuring Progress

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) that visualizes the concepts of continuity and jumps in progress, inspired by the article **"[Continuity, Jumps, and Measuring Progress](https://www.infinite-variance.com/ideas/continuity-jumps-and-measuring-progress)."** The notebook explores how progress is driven by both continuous improvement and significant "jumps" using simulations of normal distributions, Poisson processes, and jump diffusion models.

## Files

- `Continuity, Jumps, and Measuring Progress.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the simulations and visualizations.

## Simulations

The notebook performs the following simulations:

1. **Normal Distribution:**
   - Represents continuous progress, where small, consistent steps accumulate over time.
   - A normal distribution is generated with mean `0` and standard deviation `1`, and visualized using a histogram.

2. **Poisson Process:**
   - Models discrete jumps or events occurring over time, such as sudden advancements or breakthroughs.
   - A Poisson process with rate parameter `λ=3` is simulated and visualized using a histogram.

3. **Compensated Poisson Process:**
   - Combines continuous progress with discrete jumps, representing real-world scenarios where continuous improvement is occasionally interrupted by significant jumps.
   - The process is simulated by cumulatively summing the Poisson process data and compensating it by subtracting the expected linear growth. The result is visualized as a line plot.

4. **Mean of Multiple Compensated Poisson Processes:**
   - Simulates multiple paths of a compensated Poisson process and visualizes them in grey, with the mean path highlighted in brown. This emphasizes how individual paths (progress journeys) can vary while the average trajectory still shows a clear trend.

5. **Jump Diffusion Process (Merton Model):**
   - Implements a jump diffusion process based on Merton's model, which combines a standard diffusion process with sudden jumps. This model reflects situations where continuous changes are punctuated by sudden, unexpected shifts.
   - The paths of this model are plotted with varying shades of brown to indicate the progression of time and intensity of jumps.

## How to Use the Notebook

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.x
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

2. **Running the Notebook:**
   - Open the `Continuity, Jumps, and Measuring Progress.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to generate the plots and visualizations.
   - The notebook is structured to guide you through different types of progress simulations, with each section corresponding to a specific concept discussed in the article.

## Visualizations

The notebook generates several plots that visually represent different concepts of progress:

- **Normal Distribution:** A histogram representing continuous, gradual progress.
- **Poisson Process:** A histogram representing discrete, sudden jumps.
- **Compensated Poisson Process:** A line plot showing a mix of continuous progress and discrete jumps.
- **Multiple Compensated Poisson Processes:** A plot of multiple paths, emphasizing the variability in individual progress journeys.
- **Jump Diffusion Process:** A plot that shows how progress can be modeled using a combination of continuous changes and sudden shifts, with color variations representing the intensity of these jumps.
